= Introduction =

This application will allow any person to download and view the latest instrument data on their mobile device.

The main screen of the application lists all the devices in our observatory, organized by site location.  The application allows the user to scan the list of devices, select the device of interest, and see a screen detailing the latest readings for all the scalar sensors on the device.  Users can mark a device as a favourite, making it easier to view the devices of interest in subsequent use.  To help provide meaning and perspective to the readings, users can plot real-time or archived data for any time period using quick plots. Plots can be challenging to interpret in portrait mode, so the ability to intelligently scale out the plot when the device is rotated to landscape mode is provided. 

The application also allows the user to view video.  Currently only the Black and White video can be viewed, but plans are to include colour video (HD) in the future.

= Minimum requirements =

The minimum API requirements for NEPTUNE is Android 1.6 API Level 4 and later.

= Development Guide =
